Run the following commands in the same directory as the Makefile. If you want to run different levels or use another arguments, open the Makefile. It should be pretty straightforward to modify.

to clean out folder:
```make clean```


to compile project:
```make compile```


to run project (clean, compiles and runs the project):
```make run```
